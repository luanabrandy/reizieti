Hi All, Not sure if this is the correct place for this (if not please direct me elsewhere), however I'm hoping someone can help decipher this error log for me. My partners 2016 13" MacBook Pro has been rebooting at random quite regularly (seems to normally happen from waking up from sleep). Initially we thought it was a hardware issue so took it to our local Apple Store but the Genius Bar said it passed the hardware tests fine and in the end they just re-installed MacOS Mojave The following gives you an overview of relevant movies. There are 138 categories. You can use this as a challenge: make sure that you have watched at least one film from each category. (1) 80s action First Blood (1982) Conan the Barbarian (1982) The Terminator (1984) Commando (1985) Top Gun (1986) Predator (1987) RoboCop (1987) Die Hard (1988) Bloodsport (1988) The Killer (1989) (2) Black comedy Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) Withnail amp I (1987). Should I take it to the "Genius Bar?" here's the panic report: Panic Report panic(cpu 2 caller 0xffffff8015801d13): "a freed zone element has been modified in zone kalloc.128: expected 0xdeadbeefdeadbeef but found 0xffffff8066204950, bits changed 0x2152416fb88df7bf, at offset 88 of 128 in element 0xffffff803aa83d80, cookies 0x3f0011c820dc26a2 0x535217ad4075bbd"@/BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/xnu/xnu-4903.231.4/osfmk/kern/zalloc.c:1168 Backtrace (CPU 2), Frame # MAME 0.186 ( It’s been one of those long, five-week development cycles, but it’s finally time for your monthly MAME fix. There’s been a lot of touched in this release, with improvements in a number of areas. But before we get to the improvements, we have an embarrassing admission to make: the game added in 0.185 as Acchi Muite Hoi is actually Pata Pata Panic, and the sound ROM mapping was incorrect, making the game unplayable. That’s all sorted out now though # MAME 0.189 ( What better way to welcome southern Spring/northern Autumn than with a MAME release? MAME 0.189 brings general improvements across a broad range of areas: The `-sleep` and `-refreshspeed` options have been fixed (MAME will no longer use 100% of a CPU core for the least demanding systems). UI translations have been updated – Chinese, German and Greek are fully up-to-date. Many layout and navigation bugs in the system/software selection menus.

So basically out of nowhere my mac started crashing and rebooting showing an error. This is mainly when I play Diablo 3 RoS. It is a GPU panic crash, but i've been playing diablo 3 RoS on 1440 x whatever x whatever resolution for almost 2 years now with no performance issues or crashes, they literally started today. I just updated my computer to the newest OS x update but AFTER these crashes started happening. I can play about 2 mins in game before the laptop crashes. Here is the error:. My iMac is not shutting down or restarting properly lately. It gets midway through the normal shutdown/restart process then encounters a kernel panic and restarts itself roughly. I've reset the PLC and NVRAM to no effect. I worry that my logic board is getting ready to go, because I'm getting some screen flickering that isn't cured by resetting the NVRAM or turning off the light sensor. However, the panic report doesn't indicate a machine check so . I'm a little stumped. Does anyone 
Hey everyone, I've been struggling with kernel panics with my Macbook Pro (13.3 inch, mid-2009). Unfortunately, the warranty has already expired, so I'm at a loss as to what to do at the moment. The kernel panics seem to happen randomly, but the intervals between the panics seem to depend on how long the laptop has been shut down. For example, if a panic happens and I restart it, the next panic will occur within the next five to ten minutes. If I wait maybe a few days until I restart Machine: - MacBook Pro Retina 2013 with OSX Mountain Lion Symptoms Occurred when: - Overheating caused laptop to shut down while running computational pipeline through IntelliJ Kernel Panic occurs: - Upon startup 3 to 4 times, then reaches login screen normally - Whenever there is an error in Chrome (WebGL failing, Shockwave crashing, etc.) - Launching some applications (NetBeans, Kerbel Space Program) ___________________ Sample Panic Report: Interval Since Last Panic Report:.
